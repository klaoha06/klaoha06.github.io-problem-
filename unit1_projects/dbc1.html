<h3>Breif Background</h3>
<p>I went to a liberal art college named Earlham in Indiana. My major interest are Buddhism, philosophy and programming. I love traveling. I had lived in Japan for half a year through an exchange program at my college. After I finish my college, I ordained as a Buddhist monk for one year. (In my cliture it is a tradition for boys coming of age to ordain. However, it is not mandatory to be a monk for life haha many people do it for five days) After I finish my monk hood, I work with no pay for my Buddhist monastery for one year to help the temple by organizing meditation course for both Thais n foreigners. Now, i want to learn programming so I am coming San Francisco and perhaps continuing this exciting journey at DBC!
